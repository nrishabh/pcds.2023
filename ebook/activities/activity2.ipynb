    "###  Activity 2.0: Loop Ordering and False Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity reinforces the concept of reduction and the caching principles taught in the lecture on Cilk on Sep. 18. It is recommended that you run this on the CS machines `gradx.cs.jhu.edu` or `ugradx.cs.jhu.edu`.  The results make sense here.  It is OK to run this on any machine that has at least 4 cores.  If you run on different machine, you may end up with slightly different results. It is OK if your results don't track exactly with the expected findings. On my M1 laptop the results get confusing.\n",

    "There are two serial versions of the program.  These are:\n",

Since `num_tokens` is relatively small, there's a good chance that most of tokens array fits into the CPU cache. This means that, after the first few iterations for the first element, subsequent iterations for the next elements will likely benefit from cache hits when accessing the tokens array, making the memory accesses faster.\n",

The cache line will be marked as \"dirty\" in one cache and will be invalidated in other caches. This means that the next time another thread (or even the same thread) tries to access any token from that cache line, it may have to fetch the cache line from a higher-level cache or even from main memory, which is much slower than accessing it from the local cache.\n",
    "\n",
